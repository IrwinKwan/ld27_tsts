Ludum Dare 27 Log
=================

__2013-08-23	20:07:02__	I don't have a lot of time this weekend because I'm really busy, so I tell people I'm going to spend 3 hours on Ludum Dare 27. I will probably end up using more time, but I definitely can't spend the entire 48 hours building the game so I'll likely get something up and running and submit it.

__2013-08-23	20:07:44__	I say that this'll be a 3-hour game. Based on my progress on the first hour, which consists of remembering again how PyGame works, not a lot will be accomplished in 3 hours.

__2013-08-23	20:58:32__	Probably the best thing I could do to make my Ludum Dare faster is to commit to memory basic 2D geometry and trigonometry so I can calculate trajectories and directions of bullets and other similar items.

__2013-08-23	23:02:30__	A lot of the time spent today? Re-learning how to do things like sprites, collisions, layers, etc... time for bed now.
